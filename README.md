# Pokemon-Bot
This bot is in development phase and if anyone wants they make changes in it locally and provide some suggestions to improve it

<h1>How you can use this bot</h1>
First is you need to clone this repository to your local device.You need a discord account as well and a server with admin access.
After that you need to go to Discord > Settings > Advanced > Click on the higlighted 'Discord API' .There create an application and a bot .After making a bot you will get a token use this token in the last line of spawninganautoinfo.py make sure to surrond it by quotes.Also Change the channelid(wherever used in the code) to the id of a channel in your server. Start the bot and bingo! its up and running.

<h1>How To Play</h1>
When you chat in a discord channel (which the bot has access to), after a certain number of messages the bot will send an image(This is named as spawn) Players will have a chance to catch that pokemon by typing p!catch <name-of-the-pokemon>.If the name is correct ,Pog, the pokemon has been caught ,else try again.Play this bot to have fun and invite your friends and compete with each other to see who's faster /has more knowledge of pokemon names and showoff your pokemons.

<h1>Commands</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>p!catch {pokemon-name} </strong>- This command should be used to catch a spawned pokemon, once a pokemon has been caught using this command you can't catch it again</li>
  <li><strong>p!dex <pokemon-name> or p!pokedex </strong>- This command is used to show the information related to a pokemon such as its stats,type ,names in other languages etc.</li>
  <li><strong>p!start </strong>- This command is for new users and explains to them how they can start the bot,which includes picking their first pokemon. </li>
  <li><strong>p!pick {pokemon-name} </strong>- This command is for new users to pick their first pokemon and embark on their journey to catch em all</li>
  <li><strong>p!info </strong>- This command takes two types of arg one is integer which is decided by  the order in which u caught the pokemon and other is latest which is for the last pokemon caught by you</li>
  <li><strong>p!pokemon </strong>- This command is used to display your pokemon caught. This command takes many arguments 1) --n <name of the pokemon> 2) --s or --shiny 3) integer 
    The first two arguments must be clear from their name so lets discuss the 3rd one.So when displaying pokemon with this command it shows a max of 20 in a single page when u type an integer as the first argument u can go to that respective page .For example if you type p!pokemon 2 you will go to the second page of pokemon and not the first page</li>
</ul>

<h1>Things to add in the future</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Levelling system in which pokemon will level by either feeding the pokemon rare candies(available in shop) or chatting</li>
  <li>Evolution system where pokemon can evolve by levelling up or consuming certain items</li>
  <li>A trading system where you can trade pokemon with other players</li>
  <li>A currency (which would be named credits) system for the bot, people can trade pokemon and stuff with these credits </li>
  <li>A Shop where people can buy items like TMs, HMs, levelling items,evolution items and a lot more stuff</li>
  <li>A global Market which would be accessible by every player and people can add their pokemon to the market for sale for credits</li>
  <li>An Auction system for people selling their pokemon and for interested buyers to buy</li>
  <li>A duel system for pokemon to fight.This would include a database for their moves as well</li>
  <li>Raids where a group of people(limited to 6) can fight against a legendary pokemon with high health .The rewards obtained from clearing the raids would be based on difficulty of the raid (easy,normal,hard,challenge,intense)</li>
 </ul>
